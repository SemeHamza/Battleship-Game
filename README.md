# Battleship-Game
Traditional battleship game built using C++

 
 Description
  
Battleship is a guessing and strategy game which is played between two players. Owing to its long history, the game has numerous versions. However, I have chosen one of the most popular versions for the purpose of this project.

  
  Rules of the Game
  
The game is played on four 10×10 grids – two grids for each player. Usually, the individual squares on the grids are identified by letter and number.
Before the game starts, each player secretly arranges his/her ships on one of his/her grids called primary grid. Each ship occupies a specific number of consecutive squares on the grid (depending on the type of the ship) and can be oriented either horizontally or vertically - but not diagonally. The ships cannot overlap. The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. 

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds in which each player takes a turn to choose a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. Each player keeps a record of his/her shots on his/her “tracking grid” and that of the opponent on his/her “primary grid.” When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and the opponent player wins.

 
 Modifications
 
For the sake of minimizing the time needed to play a round of the game (so making testing the program easier), I have decided to modify the type and number of ships in the game while maintaining the overall idea behind the game.
